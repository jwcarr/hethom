\maketitle

\noindent
Written languages represent spoken languages. However, there are many ways in which written languages diverge. E.g. spacing between words helps readers parse a sentence even if they are not technically required. Written languages can also have there own regularities such as spelling related words similarly (magician), past tense spellings directly conveying meaning, certain spellings conveying word class ous. These features abound in writing, especially in languages such as English that have not been subject to serious regulation.

One notable case of this is the heterographic homophones---words that sound alike but which are written with different spellings. For example, <meat> and <meet> are both pronounced /miːt/. Furthermore, these spellings can be cognitively useful . For example, faced with a sentence beginning /ðɛr/, a listener will have high uncertainty about what word---or even what sentence structure---is likely to come next: a noun, as in /ðɛr dɒg/, a form of the verb to be, as in /ðɛr ɪz/, or the progressive form of a verb, as in /ðɛr gəʊɪŋ/. In writing, by contrast, this uncertainty is greatly reduced; the spellings <their>, <there>, and <they're> differentiate between these cases, giving the reader a headstart on parsing the upcoming syntax. This idiosyncratic spelling of words that are homophonous in speech may confer certain benefits in reading, particularly in terms of comprehension. Heterography permits a writing system to be---at least in some areas---more informative than its spoken counterpart.

Other languages

Irish orthography has special features to handle lenition and eclipsis. For example, when the word /pɑʃti/ (children) is eclipsed, it becomes /bɑʃti/ (the initial consonant is vocalized), but the spelling system retains the letter <p> in addition to adding a <b>: <páistí> becomes <bpáistí> under eclipsis. This allows the reader quick access to the root word from which the eclipsed form is derived and, in some cases, results in ambiguity avoidance (in this case, if the <p> were not retained, the spelling <báistí> would be confusible with the word for rain).

However, this additional informativeness comes at a cost. A system of words that conveys more information will---in general---be more complex than one that conveys less information. There exists a tradeoff between the simplicity of the spelling system and its ability to be expressive. A simple spelling system is one that is easy to learn, use, and process; for example, by being transparent with respect to phonology. The idea of a tradeoff between simplicity and informativeness in language structure has a longstanding history \parencite{Gabelentz:1891, Zipf:1949, Martinet:1952, Rosch:1978} and has recently been explored in a wide range of both typological \parencite{KempRegier:2012, Kemp:2018} and experimental \parencite{Carr:2020, Kirby:2015} studies. Of particular note here is the idea that the pressure for simplicity in language structure derives principally from learning, while the pressure for informativeness derives from the need for precise communication.

Any explanation for heterographic homophones must, therefore, demonstrate that heterographic spellings convey a benefit in terms of informativeness that is outweighed by the cost of learning the (often arbitrary) spelling distinction. What are the benefits? There seem to be broadly two kinds of benefit. (1) disambiguation in the writing of words that would otherwise be ambiguous if spelled transparently. (2) permitting the cognitive system to rapidly and accurately attain the meaning of a word. In this paper we limit ourselves to informativeness of the first kind, which is more amenable to experimental testing.

Is it possible, then, that heterography may be selected for in the cultural evolution of orthography? And if so, what might be the mechanism through which such selection could operate? \textcite[pp.~325--326]{Berg:2021} sketch two models of how a word might enter a state of heterography, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{models_of_heterography}. The first model, \textit{the differentiation model}, explains heterography through the creation of a new orthographic forms. For example, the word \textit{lite} is a respelling of \textit{light} frequently used in food products to distinguish light-in-calorific-weight from other meanings of \textit{light}; in British English, the word \textit{cheque} (perhaps influenced by \textit{exchequer}) differentiates the bank draft from other meanings of the word \textit{check}; and the word \textit{byte} was a deliberate respelling of \textit{bite} to avoid accidental mutation into the closely related term \textit{bit} \parencite{Buchholz:1977}. Etymological (and folk-etymological) spellings introduced during the Renaissance also occasionally resulted in heterographic homophones, perhaps contributing to their success: \textit{scene}--\textit{seen}, \textit{scent}--\textit{sent}, \textit{whole}--\textit{hole} \parencite[pp.~58--59]{Scragg:1974}, and many monosyllabic words that are homophonous with common function words have tended to adopt alternate spellings: \textit{be}--\textit{bee}, \textit{but}--\textit{butt}, \textit{by}--\textit{bye}--\textit{buy}, \textit{for}--\textit{fore}--\textit{four}, \textit{in}--\textit{inn}, \textit{or}--\textit{oar}--\textit{ore}, \textit{so}--\textit{sew}, \textit{to}--\textit{too}--\textit{two}, etc. Heterography is also very common in proper nouns: Surnames that are homophonous with common nouns often add <e> (\textit{Clarke}, \textit{Greene}, \textit{Wilde}) or double the final consonant (\textit{Carr}, \textit{Hogg}, \textit{Mann}), and it is common for brand names to adopt creative spellings, such as \textit{flickr}, \textit{Froot Loops}, or \textit{MVMT}.

In the differentiation model, two meanings (represented by pink and blue) are, at time $T_1$, expressed by a single phonetic form $P_1$ and a single orthographic form $O_1$; however, by time $T_2$, two orthographic forms have emerged to differentiate the meanings in writing. In the conservation model, the two distinct phonetic forms that existed at time $T_1$ have become homophonous by time $T_2$, but the two corresponding orthographic forms have been conserved, resulting in the same state of heterography as in the differentiation model.

	\end{figure}

The second model, \textit{the conservation model}, explains heterography as the historical residue of sound change: Two (or more) spoken forms merge and become homophonous, but the original heterographic spellings are conserved in the orthography. In English, for example, the meat--meet merger ultimately resulted in Middle English /ɛ:/ (spelled <ea>) and /e:/ (spelled <ee>) merging into /i:/ in Early Modern English, although the spellings were never updated accordingly, thus giving rise to a set heterographic homophones that persist in present-day English: \textit{heal}--\textit{heel}, \textit{leak}--\textit{leek}, \textit{meat}--\textit{meet}, \textit{read}--\textit{reed}, \textit{sea}--\textit{see}, \textit{team}--\textit{teem}, \textit{weak}--\textit{week}, etc. Similarly, other historic sound changes have likely resulted in (or contributed to) pairs of words entering a state of heterography, such as the reduction of /kn/ into /n/ (\textit{knight}--\textit{night}, \textit{know}--\textit{no}, \textit{knot}--\textit{not}, etc.), the loss of /ç/ (\textit{eight}--\textit{ate}, \textit{right}--\textit{rite}, \textit{sight}--\textit{site}, etc.), and the merger of /ʍ/ into /w/ (\textit{whale}--\textit{wail}, \textit{which}--\textit{witch}, \textit{whine}--\textit{wine}, etc.).

\subsection{Research questions}

Q1) Does a learning pressure (induced through cultural transmission) result in the emergence of a simple, systematic, transparent orthography that is easier to learn? Hypotheses: In the high-variation conditions, where the orthography starts out chaotic (resulting in holistic systems), we expect simpler systems to emerge. Simplicity may be realized in a number of ways. Transparent systems use a one-to-one mapping to directly represent the spoken forms in writing. Redundant systems retain some spelling variation (with idiosyncratic spellings of the suffix for each shape) but become simpler by collapsing across colour. Expressive systems continue to express colour, but do so with a non-transparent but easy to learn compositional suffix system. The prevalence of these three types of system will be influenced by the presence of the communicative pressure. When communication is not present, transparent systems will tend to dominate, alongside some redundant systems and possibly some expressive systems. When communication is present, expressive systems will tend to dominate, perhaps with some redundant and holistic forms. The gradual emergence of simplicity, whatever form it takes, should be accompanied by increased learnability.

Q2) Can a writing system evolve to become more informative than its uninformative spoken counterpart? Hypotheses: Yes, but preferentially when two vital ingredients are present: a communicative pressure for informativeness (which makes an expressive system desirable) and high variation (which provides the building blocks to make that happen). When both ingredients are present, expressive systems will tend to dominate. If only one of the ingredients is available (either communication or high variation), informative systems may emerge but are less likely. In the case of learning-only and high-variation, expressive systems may emerge if the learners – yearning for an explanation for the variation – assume that colour must somehow be involved and therefore impose (perhaps unconsciously) colour-expressive structure on the language (i.e. learners may, to a certain extent, have a preconceived notion that languages ought to be informative). In the case of communication and no variation (where, again, only one of the ingredients is met), expressive systems may emerge but this is highly dependent on participants being 'innovators' who are willing to develop novel spelling systems that diverge from the spoken system in order to express colour. If neither ingredient is present, expressive systems will not emerge.

\section{Experiment 1}

Our first experiment tests the ability of the differentiation model to explain the emergence of informativeness in orthography. In particular we had two main hypotheses:


Preregistered \url{https://aspredicted.org/YLG_CKD}

\subsection{Methods}

To simulate the cultural evolution of orthography, we adopt the experimental iterated learning paradigm \parencite{Kirby:2008, Kirby:2015}. In this paradigm, some linguistic system is passed along a \textit{transmission chain} of human participants, resulting in repeated cycles of learning and production. Participant $i$ in a transmission chain learns the system based on the linguistic output of participant $i-1$ and then produces new linguistic output for participant $i+1$ to learn from. Following several \textit{generations} of this process, the linguistic system can gradually adapt to the learning biases of the human learners, yielding interesting emergent phenomena, such as compositionality \parencite{Kirby:2008, Kirby:2015}, combinatoriality \parencite{Verhoef:2015}, category structure \parencite{Carr:2017, Carr:2020}, and regularization \parencite{Smith:2010, Ferdinand:2019}. To explore the hypotheses outlined above, we conducted the experiment under two conditions: Transmission-only and Transmission + Communication.

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited 287 participants via the Prolific platform. Participants were paid £2.00 for participation plus additional bonuses of up to £1.08 as detailed below (median bonus: £0.74). The median completion time was 15~m with a median hourly rate of £8.05 (£10.94 including bonus). We limited recruitment to (self-declared) native English speakers, since it was important that participants would perceive the spoken forms in a relatively consistent way (particularly in the case of Experiment~2). 14 participants were excluded because they (or their partners) used English color words or failed the auditory attention checks. A further three participants were lost to communication-game pairing failures. The final dataset comprises 270 participants: 90 in the Transmission-only condition (10 chains of 9 subjects) and 180 in the Transmission + Communication condition (10 chains of 9 pairs of subjects).

\subsubsection{Stimuli}

	\begin{figure}
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[]{figs/stimuli.eps}}
	\vspace*{2pt}
	\caption{The nine alien object stimuli with their iconic stems (indicating shape) and suffixes (indicating color). The spoken forms of the suffixes are homophonous, but their associated spellings are free to evolve and may therefore take on differentiated forms.}
	\label{stimuli}
	\end{figure}

Participants were taught words for nine ``alien'' objects---three shapes (pentagon, star, torus) in three colors (pink, yellow, blue), as depicted in Fig.~\ref{stimuli}. The alien words had a spoken and written form composed of a stem and suffix. The stems, which always express the shape dimension, were /buvɪ/ <buvi> (the pentagon), /zɛtɪ/ <zeti> (the star), and /wɒpɪ/ <wopi> (the torus). These stems were fixed and unchanging throughout both experiments reported in this paper and were designed to be easy to learn by being graphically and phonetically iconic of the shapes they represent. Throughout Experiment~1, the spoken form of the suffix was always pronounced /kəʊ/, but its spelling was free to change over time. Thus, the spoken form of the language consists of just three unique words---/buvɪkəʊ/, /zɛtɪkəʊ/, and /wɒpɪkəʊ/---that mark only a shape distinction; however, the spelling of the suffix could potentially take on different forms to mark color.

Each of the 10 transmission chains was seeded with a randomly-generated suffix spelling system. This was created by randomly mapping the following nine spellings onto the nine objects: <co>, <coe>, <coh>, <ko>, <koe>, <koh>, <qo>, <qoe>, <qoh>. In other words, the /k/ sound may be spelled <c>, <k>, or <q> and the /əʊ/ sound may be spelled <o>, <oe>, or <oh>, although the initial seed system contains no particular regularity. This models an initial state of high spelling variation (every object has a unique suffix spelling), which may, over time, become transparent (the /k/ and/or /əʊ/ sounds take on consistent spellings) or expressive (spellings of /k/ and/or /əʊ/ become systematically associated with meaning). The spoken forms were synthesized using the Apple text-to-speech synthesizer (Tessa voice).

\subsubsection{Transmission procedure}

	\begin{figure}
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[]{figs/transmission.eps}}
	\vspace*{2pt}
	\caption{(A) Transmission-only procedure. Each generation consists of a single participant, who first receives training on six of the nine suffixes and then produces suffixes for all nine items. These productions are then used as the training material for the next generation in the chain. The initial system of suffixes is randomly generated with high spelling variation; but by the ninth generation, the system is expected to become transparent. (B) Transmission + Communication procedure. Each generation now consists of two participants who engage in a communicative task. Both participants receive training on the same system from the previous generation. Under a communicative pressure, the suffix spellings are expected to become expressive of color, despite the spoken forms being homophonous.}
	\label{transmission}
	\end{figure}

As outlined above, the participants were arranged into transmission chains such that the spellings produced by one participant would subsequently be taught to the next participant in the chain (see Fig.~\ref{transmission}A). The first participant in a chain was taught the initial, randomly generated seed system, and this system was then free to evolve as it was culturally transmitted. Importantly, this process was subject to a bottleneck on transmission: Not all nine spellings were transmitted from one generation to the next; rather, the participant at generation $i$ would observe only six of the nine spellings generated at generation $i-1$ (at least one of each shape and at least one of each color). Nevertheless, participants were asked to produce a spelling for all nine objects, meaning that generalization was required for the three unseen items. Transmission continued for nine generations in each of the ten independent chains.

\subsubsection{Training procedure}

All participants were trained on the spoken and written forms through a combination of passive exposure trials and ``mini-test'' trials. Participants were also told explicitly that the stems were iconic of the objects' shapes, allowing participants to focus on learning the suffixes during the training phase. In passive exposure trials, the alien objects were presented alongside the written and spoken forms in quick succession for 2~s each. In mini-test trials, which were interleaved among the passive exposure trials, the participant was asked to type in the appropriate written form for an object and was given feedback on any errors (deleted characters shown in red strikethrough text and additions shown in bold green text). The participant received a 2p bonus for spelling the word correctly but had to submit their response within 20~s. Each of the six object--word pairs in the training set (i.e., the seen items that passed through the bottleneck on transmission) was passively exposed 18 times and mini-tested six times, resulting in a total of 108 passive exposure trials and 36 mini-test trials (the maximum bonus in training was therefore 72p). To check that participants were listening to the spoken forms, they were asked auditorily to click on the alien object at three random points during training; participants who did not follow this instruction were excluded.

\subsubsection{Test procedure in Transmission-only}

After training, participants assigned to the Transmission-only condition completed a test phase, alternating between production and comprehension trials. In production trials, the participant was shown an object and heard its associated word pronounced aloud. The participant's task was to type~in the appropriate spelling. The input box was limited to eight lowercase Latin characters, and participants had to spell the stem correctly to continue to the next trial. Since participants heard the word pronounced aloud, typing the stem correctly should have been trivial, but in cases where the stem was initially spelled incorrectly, a popup message explicitly reminded the participant of the correct spelling of the stem. This restriction was imposed to prevent the stems from diverging from their spoken forms over time; however, no such restriction was imposed on the spelling of the suffix. Since the overall word length was restricted to eight characters and since all stems were four letters long, participants could use, at a minimum, a zero suffix and, at a maximum, a four-letter suffix. In comprehension trials, the participant was shown a word and had to click on the matching object from an array of all nine objects arranged in random order (in cases where multiple objects were described by the same wordform, any of the objects was a valid choice). In both types of test trial, the participant was awarded a bonus of 2p for each correct answer, but no explicit feedback was provided. Each of the nine object--word pairs (i.e., including unseen items) was tested once in production and once in comprehension, resulting in 18 trials (the maximum bonus in test was therefore 36p).

\subsubsection{Test procedure in Transmission + Communication}

Participants assigned to the communicative condition completed a live, over-the-internet communication game with another participant, who had received training on the same orthographic system inherited from the previous generation (albeit on an independently selected set of seen items). The game closely mirrored the overall structure of the test administered to participants in the non-communicative condition, with the production and comprehension trials becoming the two sides of a single communicative interaction. On a given trial, one participant (the director) would complete a production trial under the same input restrictions described above (i.e., produce a form for a target meaning), and the word they used was relayed to the other participant (the matcher), who would then complete a comprehension trial in response to that word (i.e., pick an object from the matcher array). The two participants then switched roles, resulting in the same overall trial structure as the transmission-only condition (i.e., alternation between production and comprehension trials and the same bonusing scheme).

The framing and goal of the communication game was, however, quite different from the non-communicative test. In communication, the shared goal of the director and matcher is to have a successful communicative interaction, not necessarily to reproduce what they had learned in training. Both participants received the 2p bonus each time an interaction was successful; that is, the reward structure is not based on using the ``correct'' forms taught in training but based on accurately conveying meaning. The director is thus incentivized to produce a wordform that is unambiguous, and the matcher is incentivized to carefully interpret what the director has attempted to convey. The second important difference from the non-communicative test was that participants received rich feedback on the interaction: The director saw which object the matcher clicked on, and the matcher saw which object was the correct target. Overall, then, the communication game is identical to the non-communicative test in terms of the task to be performed (nine productions and nine comprehensions), but the goal is quite different: In the non-communicative test, the goal and reward structure is based on accurately reproducing the orthography learned during training, whereas in the communication game, the goal and reward structure is based on successfully communicating a target object.

\subsection{Results}

	\begin{figure}
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[]{figs/dif_lrn.eps}}
	\vspace*{2pt}
	\caption{Results from the Transmission-only condition in Experiment~1 (differentiation). Each matrix shows the suffix spelling system in use at a particular generation (shape on the rows, color on the columns, as in Fig.~\ref{stimuli}). Chains are labeled A--J and generations are labeled 0–9 (0 is the randomly generated seed system). Each chain uses an independent color palette, with each color representing a particular suffix spelling; similar colors indicate similar spellings. Spellings in bold-italic are the generalizations on unseen items. By the ninth generation, most systems are degenerate (e.g., Chains~A, B, and~I), redundant (e.g., Chains~D, E, and~H), or a mixture of the two (e.g., Chain~F).}
	\label{dif_lrn}
	\end{figure}

The results from all ten chains (labelled A--J) in the Transmission-only condition are shown in Fig.~\ref{dif_lrn}. Each 3×3 matrix represents the suffix spelling system in use at a particular generation with shape down the rows and color along the columns, just as in Fig.~\ref{stimuli}. For example, the system at Generation~9 in Chain~D uses three spellings---<koe>, <ko>, and <co>---to express the shape dimension. We describe such a system as ``redundant'' because shape is consistently expressed by the stem, so the suffix spellings that emerged in this case convey no additional information beyond what is already conveyed by the stem. Similar outcomes occurred in Chains~C, E, F, and~H and are characteristic of the Transmission-only condition. We also saw the emergence of fully transparent suffix spelling systems in Chains~A, B, I, and~J. Chain~I, for example, ultimately uses a single spelling, <coe>, to represent the /kəʊ/ sound; that is, the written suffix forms make no distinction between shapes or colors, just like the spoken language. Chain~G did not settle on a clear pattern, using <co>, <coe>, and <coh> somewhat interchangeably in the final generation, although there were some signs of a color-expressive system emerging in, for example, Generation~6, where yellow is consistently spelled <coh>, blue is consistently spelled <coe>, and pink uses both <co> and <coe>. The only other signs of color-expressive systems are H1, which was rapidly converted into a redundant system in subsequent generations, and J2, which ultimately degenerated towards transparency.

	\begin{figure}
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[]{figs/dif_com.eps}}
	\vspace*{2pt}
	\caption{Results from the Transmission + Communication condition in Experiment~1 (differentiation). Each matrix shows the suffix spelling system in use at a particular generation (shape on the rows, color on the columns, as in Fig.~\ref{stimuli}). Chains are labeled K--T and generations are labeled 0–9 (0 is the randomly generated seed system). Each chain uses an independent color palette, with each color representing a particular suffix spelling; similar colors indicate similar spellings. Spellings in bold-italic are the generalizations on unseen items. There are some isolated examples of differentiation through implicit generalization (K5, M1, P5, S2) and explicit innovation (K9, L7, M7, O4, Q7).}
	\label{dif_com}
	\end{figure}

The results for the Transmission + Communication condition (Chains~K--T) are shown in Fig.~\ref{dif_com}. Like Transmission-only, degeneration to a single spelling by the ninth generation is a relatively common outcome (e.g., Chains~N, R, and~S and to a lesser extent Chains~L, M, and~O). In contrast, redundant, shape-expressive systems (as indicated by horizontal stripes) are relatively rare (e.g., K8, M6 and Q1--6). Instead, the presence of the communicative task appears to favor color-expressive systems, although these are far from common and often unstable. In particular, there are two main kinds of color-expressive system that emerge. The first are the generalization-based expressive systems: K5, M1, P5, and S2. In these cases, the participant tended to generalize their input in a way that is consistent with expressing color over shape. For example, in K5, pink was consistently spelled <ko> and blue was consistently spelled <co>. In the case of M1, color is expressed by the final vowel letters (<oe> for pink, <o> for yellow, and <oh> for blue) with the spelling of the /k/ sound conditioned on the stem (<buvic->, <zetik->, and <wopiq->). We note, however, that in all these cases the expressive system was not reciprocated by the participant's partner, resulting in low communicative accuracy, and not sustained or elaborated~on in subsequent generations.

The second type of color-expressive system is one that simply appropriates the expressive power of English to differentiate color: K9, M7, Q7, and to a lesser extent L7 and O4. In M7, for example, the participant added <r>, <g>, and <b> (presumably red, gold, blue) to the ends of the words, although the participant's partner only reciprocated the <g> spelling and seemingly failed to understand what was meant by <r> and <b>. In the case of Q7, the pair of participants added <r>, <o>, and <b> (presumably red, orange, blue) to communicate with high accuracy, but, although this system was retained into Generation~8, it started to disintegrate by Generation~9. Overall, in the five cases where English color letters were used, the systems did not really catch~on, perhaps because they retained spelling redundancy from the previous generation, resulting in unnecessarily complex suffix spellings that express both shape and color simultaneously. Q7, for example, uses <-coe->, <-co->, <-qo-> for shape plus <-r>, <-o>, <-b> for color. In addition to this handful of cases, there were a further four pairs of participants who used full English words as the suffix (typically <-blue>, <-oran>, <-pink>, <-red>, <-yell>), but these pairs were excluded and replaced with a new pair before iteration to the next generation.\footnote{In our preregistration, we stated that we would reject participants who used English color words. However, we allowed single letters because these were typically less transparent, especially in cases where the choice of letter (e.g., <g> or <r>) did not match how another person might have perceived the color (yellow vs.\@ gold vs.\@ orange or pink vs.\@ red). Indeed, as we see in the results, subsequent generations often did not pick~up~on the color letters (L9, M8, and Q9).} We mention these cases, however, because they are still examples of a conscious effort to differentiate---something that never happened in the Transmission-only condition.



Learnability, measured as transmission error (lower error = higher learnability). Mean Levenshtein edit distance between the words produced at generation i and the corresponding words produced at generation i-1.

Simplicity, measured as complexity (lower complexity = higher simplicity). The length (in bits) of the shortest grammar that losslessly compresses the lexicon, as computed by the Grammarette package: https://github.com/jwcarr/grammarette. Finding the shortest grammar for some lexicon is a non-trivial problem, and it is likely that we will need to adapt the method in response to the collected data.

Communicative cost is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{cost}(L) := \frac{1}{|U|} \sum_{m \in U} -\log \mathrm{Pr}(m|s_m),
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{Pr}(m|s_m)$ is the probability that a listener would infer meaning $m$ given that a speaker produced signal $s$ for meaning $m$. Here we assume this probability to be $1/|M_s|$, where $M_s$ is the set of meanings labeled $s$.

To analyze the variation in the suffix spellings and how it correlates with meaning, each participant's system was transformed into a 3×3 matrix, with rows representing the shape dimension, columns representing the color dimension, and the matrix values representing the unique spellings. For example, a ``degenerate'' system of suffix spellings---one that uses a single spelling for all meanings---would have the following matrix representation:
\begin{equation}
	S_\mathrm{degenerate} = \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 1 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Here the number 1 represents the one and only suffix spelling. We define an ``expressive'' system as one that marks the color dimension using three distinct spellings, resulting in the following matrix:
\begin{equation}
	S_\mathrm{expressive} = \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 3 \\
	1 & 2 & 3 \\
	1 & 2 & 3
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
In such a system, although the suffix only expresses color, the words as a whole are fully informative, since shape is expressed by the stem. A third system of interest is the ``redundant'' system:
\begin{equation}
	S_\mathrm{redundant} = \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 1 & 1 \\
	2 & 2 & 2 \\
	3 & 3 & 3
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Although $S_\mathrm{redundant}$ carries the same amount of information as $S_\mathrm{expressive}$, it marks a dimension (shape) that is already expressed by the stem, making the information carried by the suffix redundant. Such a system contains unnecessary complexity---different ways of writing /kəʊ/ that carry no additional information.

Of course, the suffix spelling systems produced by participants may not match these three reference systems exactly. To determine which reference system a participant's output system is most similar to, we adopt variation of information \parencite[VoI;][]{Meila:2007} as a distance metric. VoI is a proper metric on set partitions, measuring the amount of information (in bits) that is lost and gained in the transformation of one set partition into another. So, for example, the distance between $S_\mathrm{degenerate}$ and $S_\mathrm{expressive}$ is 2~bits because $S_\mathrm{expressive}$ conveys 2~bits of information\footnote{In $S_\mathrm{expressive}$, knowing the suffix reduces uncertainty from 16 equally probable meanings to 4 equally probable meanings; $-\log\frac{4}{16} = 2$~bits.}, 2~bits more than $S_\mathrm{degenerate}$, which conveys 0~bits of information. The distance between $S_\mathrm{expressive}$ and $S_\mathrm{redundant}$ is 4~bits; this is because, although both systems convey 2~bits of information, the information they convey is entirely orthogonal; in switching from $S_\mathrm{expressive}$ to $S_\mathrm{redundant}$, one loses 2~bits of information (information about color), but one gains 2~bits of information (information about shape), making the total distance 4~bits.

We computed the VoI between the emergent suffix systems and the three reference systems and plotted them on a ternary diagram, the three vertices of which represent the three reference systems (see Fig.~\ref{exp1_ternary_plot}). The diagram is divided into three sectors (shades of gray), which reveal which reference system the final converged-on suffix systems are most similar to. Most of the emergent system are either redundant or degenerate, with some straddling the border between the two. No system is classified as expressive, although two of the converged-on systems (highlighted in Fig.~\ref{exp1_ternary_plot}) showed some signs of color-marking. In one system, <icoe> is used for gray objects and <ikoe> for all other colors. In the other system, <ikcow> is used for gray objects and <ikoe> is used for all other colors, except the star shape uses <y> instead of <i> (i.e., <ykcow> and <ykoe>), resulting in some spelling redundancy\footnote{However, rather than parsing the stems as <buv>, <zett>, <gaf>, <wop>, they could instead be parsed as <buvi>, <zetty>, <gafi>, <wopi>. Under this interpretation, there would be no redundancy and the system would be equivalent to the other 1-color emergent system.} In general, there is no discernible difference between the two conditions; regardless of whether the communicative pressure was present, the emergent suffix spelling systems tended to fall along the degenerate--redundant axis, and the only two cases of color-marking were in~fact from the Transmission-only condition.

\subsection{Summary}

Our first experiment tested the ability of the differentiation model to explain the emergence of an informative, heterographic orthography, but we found little evidence of systematic orthographic differentiation. Exposed to an orthography with high variation, learners could have gradually conditioned that variation on the dimension where it would have been useful from the point of view of disambiguation, color, yielding differentiated forms in the orthography. But this did not happen, even under the communicative pressure. Instead, when spelling variation was conditioned on anything, it was conditioned on shape, resulting in redundant suffix spellings. This result is in stark contrast to most prior experimental iterated learning studies, in which informative, compositional systems do typically emerge, especially under communicative pressure. So, what was different about the present experiment? The primary difference was the presence of a spoken language that is decidedly \textit{not} informative, which acts as a cue to participants that the language does not mark color and that, therefore, the orthography should not mark color. Faced with variation that could be conditioned on shape or color, learners rule out the possibility that it might be conditioned on color, since such a hypothesis would be in conflict with the spoken language. As a result, variation in spelling comes to be associated with particular stems, resulting in the emergence of idiosyncratic suffix spellings that serve no real purpose. A rough analog of this redundancy can be found in English in the spelling of the /ʃən/ suffix (<cian>, <sion>, <ssion>, or <tion>), which is largely conditioned on the stem (e.g., \textit{magician}, \textit{expansion} \textit{transmission}, and \textit{invention}).

Another pathway through which differentiation could have occurred is through conscious innovation, especially in the communicative conditions, where participants could have increased their bonuses substantially by innovating a system of color markers. However, there was no evidence of such innovation, and only four participants mentioned that they even \textit{considered} this possibility in their post-test comments (e.g., ``I wondered if I should use the color suffix rule even where I did not think it was the right word to try and help my partner get the right color object''). Why do participants choose not to innovate or even regularize an imperfect system? Firstly, although innovation was not expressly forbidden, it was perhaps suggested by the overall structure of the experiment that we expected them to use the orthography learned during training. Participants who adopted this interpretation may have feared diverging from their training either because they themselves wanted to avoid breaking the rules or because they did not know whether their partner would feel comfortable breaking the rules. Secondly, even if participants are willing to diverge, they are presented with an alignment problem: How can they decide what system of color marking to use when there is no channel through which they can have a meta-discussion? They can only use trial-and-error, and even then, the process is complicated by participants simultaneously adapting to each other's systems. Interestingly, these are dynamics that also exist in the real world, where deviation from received, sacrosanct spellings is considered socially unacceptable or uneducated (e.g., the non-standard spelling <thru> has struggled for decades---or perhaps centuries---to make any headway against <through>), and even under more progressive attitudes to change and innovation, the problem of achieving community buy-in remains, especially when the change is not imposed by top-down authority: If I decided to start using the spelling <banque> to differentiate the financial institution from river banks, would anyone take my spelling seriously or even understand the distinction I was trying to make?

Overall, our first experiment suggests that differentiation---be it through a self-organizing process in learning or through a conscious process of innovation in use---is not a good model of heterography, unless enforced by top-down authority. We now turn to consider the conservation model.

\section{Experiment 2}

We now turn our attention to the conservation model of heterographic homophones: Given that an informative system already exists (both in speech and in writing), does that informative system persist in writing even after the spoken language has degenerated into homophony? And, importantly, does this happen preferentially in the presence of a communicative pressure?

\subsection{Methods}

The methods were largely identical to Experiment~1 with two major exceptions: The artificial language used to seed each chain started out fully compositional (in both its spoken and written forms), and two sound mergers were artificially induced during cultural transmission, resulting in the spoken forms of the suffixes becoming increasingly uninformative over time.

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited 297 native-English participants via the Prolific platform. The payment and bonusing scheme was identical to Experiment~1 (median bonus: £0.78). The median completion time was 15~m with a median hourly rate of £7.99 (£10.68 including bonus). 17 participants were excluded because they (or their partners) used English color words or failed the auditory attention checks. A further 10 participants were lost to communication-game pairing failures. Like Experiment~1, the final dataset comprises 270 participants: 90 in the Transmission-only condition (10 chains of 9 subjects) and 180 in the Transmission + Communication condition (10 chains of 9 pairs of subjects).

\subsubsection{Stimuli}

The alien objects and word stems were identical to Experiment~1. Unlike Experiment~1, however, the transmission chains were seeded with a fully compositional language that uses three distinct suffixes to systematically express each of the colors. These suffixes were made~up~of a consonant from the set \{/f/, /s/, /ʃ/\} and a vowel from the set \{/ə/, /ɛɪ/, /əʊ/\}, but the exact forms were randomized for each chain (e.g., one chain might use the suffixes /fəʊ/, /ʃə/, /sɛɪ/, while another chain might use /sə/, /fɛɪ/, /ʃəʊ/). The initial orthographic system was transparent and generated based on the following phoneme–grapheme mapping: \{/f/→<f>, /s/→<s>, /ʃ/→<x>, /ə/→<a>, /ɛɪ/→<ei>, /əʊ/→<oe>\}. The suffixes were designed to be distinctive (and therefore easy to memorize and associate with colors), but also similar enough to (mostly) allow for somewhat plausible sound mergers and result in somewhat plausible spellings following sound merger (e.g., it is plausible that /f/ might supplant /s/ in speech or that /ʃ/ might be spelled <s> in writing). We attempted to achieve this balance by combining consonants that are very similar with vowels that are very dissimilar, while also avoiding reuse of any sounds present in the stems. The spoken forms were synthesized using the Apple text-to-speech synthesizer (Moira voice).

\subsubsection{Sound change}

	\caption{Examples of the spoken suffixes in Experiment~2. During Epoch~I, color is represented by three distinct spoken suffixes. During Epoch~II, two of the suffixes are homophonous, reducing the informativeness of the spoken language. During Epoch~III, the spoken form of the language makes no color distinction.}
	\label{sound_change}
	\end{figure}

As in Experiment~1, each transmission chain was run for nine generations. Additionally, the nine generations were divided into three epochs, each lasting three generations. During Epoch~I (Generations~1 to~3), the three spoken suffixes were distinct (as described above), allowing the spoken language to express all three colors without ambiguity. During Epoch~II (Generations~4 to~6), the spoken language had two distinct suffix forms, reducing its informativeness. During Epoch~III (Generations~7 to~9), all three spoken suffixes were homophonous, just as in Experiment~1, making the spoken language entirely uninformative about color. This was achieved through two sets of sound changes, the first occurring in the transition from Epoch~I to~II and the second occurring in the transition from Epoch~II to~III. An example is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{sound_change}. In the first sound change, two of the spoken suffix forms were chosen at random and the consonant from one (chosen at random) was paired with the vowel from the other, resulting in a new suffix form that replaced the original two. For example, a language that uses the suffixes /fəʊ/, /ʃə/, /sɛɪ/ in Epoch~I, might use the suffixes /fɛɪ/, /ʃə/, /fɛɪ/ in Epoch~II (i.e., /s/→/f/ and /əʊ/→/ɛɪ/). In the second sound change, the remaining two suffix forms were merged in the same way, resulting in full homophony. For example, in Epoch~III, the suffixes might become /fə/, /fə/, /fə/ (i.e., /ʃ/→/f/ and /ɛɪ/→/ə/). Crucially, the spellings do not automatically change following a sound change event; rather, the orthographic system is free to adapt (or not) in response to the sound changes.
